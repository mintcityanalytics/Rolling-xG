Rolling xG and xGA data viz for Charlotte FC
![5RA_07_10_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104807291/178861850-d91b2da2-309d-4966-87ec-51dc4b857d76.png)
This is the first Charlotte FC rolling average expected goals and expected goals allowed data viz. 
The code I uploaded is for a 5 match average, but that's due to Charlotte FC's small sample size.
Really should be a 10 match rolling average minimum. StatsBomb even has figures with 18 match averages.
