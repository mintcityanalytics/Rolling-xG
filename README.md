# Rolling-xG
Way too early rolling xG data viz for Charlotte FC
![3RA_May_16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104807291/169740395-82896015-0667-4a79-a3dc-92348e204fca.png)
This is my first crack at a rolling average expected goals and expected goals allowed data viz. 
The code I uploaded is for a 3 match average, but that's due to Charlotte FC's small sample size.
Really should be a 5 match rolling average minimum. StatsBomb even has figures with 18 match averages.
